# kanga

Genetic‐Algorithm–Aided **K**olmogorov–**A**rnold **N**etworks for fast **symbolization** pipelines.  
The project explores how an evolutionary filter of *28 univariate primitives* (mask chromosome) can shrink the search space **before** training a KAN and collapsing it into an explicit symbolic equation.
